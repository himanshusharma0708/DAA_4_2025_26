A heap is a complete binary tree, so its height is always O(log n).

When deleting an element at a given index in a heap, the following steps are performed:

The element at the given index is replaced with the last element of the heap.
This operation takes O(1) time.

After replacement, the heap property may be violated. To restore it, heapifyUp and heapifyDown operations are applied.

In heapifyUp, the element is compared only with its parent and moved upward along a single path.
Since the height of the heap is O(log n), heapifyUp takes O(log n) time.

In heapifyDown, the element is compared only with its children and moved downward along a single path.
Again, the maximum number of levels is O(log n), so heapifyDown also takes O(log n) time.

At no point are all n elements of the heap traversed. Only one root-to-leaf or leaf-to-root path is adjusted.

Therefore, the total time complexity is:

O(1) + O(log n) + O(log n) = O(log n)
